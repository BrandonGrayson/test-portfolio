                <p className='aboutTxt'>Hi, Im Brandon. Thanks for dropping by. Let me show you around. Well for starters JavaScript is my Primary language. I'm fascinated by the possibilities. I love working on New Projects, talking about abstract ideas, and testing the waters to see if there is a way to breathe life into the things I envision. </p>
